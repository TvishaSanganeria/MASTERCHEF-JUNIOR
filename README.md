Ingredients
* 225 gm pasta penne
* 4 cloves garlic
* 2 teaspoon basil
* salt as required
* 2 pinches powdered black pepper
* 2 red chilli
* 450 gm tomato
* 1/2 teaspoon chilli flakes
* 1 tablespoon parsley
* 1 1/2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 3 cup water

Procedure
1. Heat oil in a pan over medium flame and add minced garlic along with chopped red chilli and red chilli flakes. Stir and saute for 2 minutes. Take another pan, pour the water and bring it to a boil. Then, add pasta to the boiling water along with some salt and 1/2 tbsp oil. Cook the pasta for a few minutes. When it is cooked through, drain the extra water and transfer the pasta to another bowl.
2. Now, heat the olive oil and add the peeled (or pureed) tomatoes, basil and parsley to the pan. Mix all the ingredients well and let it simmer for 10 minutes until the sauce starts to thicken. When the sauce starts gaining consistency, put off the burner and add salt and black pepper powder to the sauce. Keep the sauce warm. Add the pasta over the warm sauce and toss carefully so that each piece is coated with the sauce.
3. Cook for 2-3 minutes more and then serve the Red Sauce Pasta immediately. To make it more aromatic, you can dry roast a few basil leaves, crush them with some chilli flakes, oregano and add it to the dish. This herb fusion will make your pasta even more delectable. Serve it with garlic bread and relish this delicious pasta.

Tips

3. If you cannot find roma tomatoes in your vegetable market, try to find store bought tomato puree for the sauce.
4. If you do not have olive oil, you can use any vegetable oil for making the pasta.
5. You can also add finely chopped broccoli, corns, grated cabbage etc. in your pasta if you like.
